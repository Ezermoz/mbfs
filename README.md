# How to use

# Why it does not work? 
The tool only works for cracked minecraft servers !
If that doesn't work, check that you have set IPv4 in the 1st question. The SRV protocol is poorly managed. (To find the IPV4 please go to: mcsrvstat.us)

Go to ./config.json to modify the input message in the server. 
You can even change the number / order of messages in ./index.js:34:23 !
